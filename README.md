# AirCoach: Project Documentation
**The Intelligence Layer for Urban Health**

---

## 1. The Problem: Pollution

Air pollution is responsible for 7 million deaths annually, but for the average person, it remains an invisible threat.

Current solutions (like standard weather apps or government sensors) fail in two ways:

- **They are Reactive**: They tell you the air is bad right now, when you are already breathing it.
- **They lack Context**: They give you a number (AQI 150) but don't explain why it's bad or when it will get better.

**The Result**: People freeze. They don't know if they should open a window, wear a mask, or cancel their run. They lack a decision-making tool.

---

## 2. The Solution: AirCoach

AirCoach is an app designed to move beyond monitoring pollution to **avoid it**.

We act as a **Health Decision Layer**. By combining real-time traffic patterns with historical air quality data, we provide the missing link: **Causality**.

We don't just say: *"The air is toxic."*

We say: *"Traffic is gridlocked on Victory Square. The air will remain toxic for about 45 minutes. Take the side route."*

---

## 3. Core Features & How They Solve the Problem

### A. The "Why": Traffic-Pollution Correlation

**The Problem**: Users see a red map but don't know if it's a permanent smog cloud or a temporary traffic jam.

**Our Solution**: We overlay live traffic jams onto pollution heatmaps.

**User Benefit**: You instantly see the source of the pollution. If you see a "Red Road," you know it is a dynamic, traffic-based hazard that you can avoid by moving two streets away.

### B. The "When": 24-Hour Predictive Analysis

**The Problem**: "Can I open my windows in an hour?" Standard apps only tell you the air quality right now, leaving you guessing about the future.

**Our Solution**: We process a continuous 24-hour data stream of air quality history and forecasts. Our system analyzes the entire day's trend to identify exactly when pollution levels will drop.

### C. The Assistant: Fact-Checked AI Chatbot

**The Problem**: Medical advice on pollution is confusing and hard to find.

**Our Solution**: An integrated AI assistant verified against medical sources (RAG technology).

**User Benefit**: Instead of interpreting graphs, users ask natural questions: *"I have asthma, can I walk to the park right now?"* and get a simple "Yes" or "No" based on live data.

### D. The Shield: Smart Home Automation

**The Problem**: You can't watch an app 24/7.

**Our Solution**: AirCoach connects to ecosystems like Google Home.

**User Benefit**: Passive protection. If pollution spikes while you are asleep, AirCoach automatically triggers your connected air purifier.

---

## 4. How It Works (Simplified Logic)

We use a **Hybrid Precision Model** that operates in three steps:

1. **Ingest (The Senses)**: We pull raw data from trusted global sources (Open-Meteo for history/forecasts) and real-time city data (Google Traffic).

2. **Correlate**: Our system looks for patterns. When it sees "Stop-and-Go" traffic, it flags that area as a "High-Risk Emission Zone" instantly, even before traditional air sensors pick it up.

3. **Advise**: We translate these complex data overlaps into simple colors (Green/Red) and plain text advice via the AI Assistant.

### 5.3 The Data Pipeline: From Raw Data to Insights

#### **Step 1: Data Collection (Python Scripts)**

AirCoach runs three autonomous data pipelines that continuously feed the system:

##### **A. Air Quality Pipeline** (`live_air_quality.py`)
- **Source**: Google Air Quality API
- **Coverage**: 1,000 monitoring points across Bucharest (strategically distributed across all 6 sectors)
- **Frequency**: Real-time updates every 15-30 minutes
- **Data Collected**:
  - **Particulates**: PM1, PM2.5, PM10, dust, aerosol optical depth
  - **Gases**: CO, CO₂, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, NH₃, CH₄
  - **Pollen**: 6 types (ragweed, olive, alder, birch, grass, mugwort)
  - **UV Radiation**: Current UV index + clear-sky forecast
  - **Air Quality Indices**: European AQI (0-500) + US AQI (0-500)

**Technical Flow**:
```python
for location in BUCHAREST_LOCATIONS (1000 points):
    fetch_air_quality(lat, lon) → Google API
    parse_pollutants(response)
    calculate_health_recommendations()
    insert_into_database(pollution_data table)
```

**Key Innovation**: Unlike traditional systems with 10-20 sensors per city, our 1000-point grid provides **hyperlocal precision** (street-level accuracy).

##### **B. Traffic Pipeline** (`traffic_collector_db.py`)
- **Source**: Real-time traffic APIs (Google Traffic + TomTom)
- **Coverage**: Major roads, intersections, and boulevards in Bucharest
- **Frequency**: Live updates every 5 minutes during rush hours, 15 minutes off-peak
- **Data Collected**:
  - Current speed vs. free-flow speed
  - Congestion level: `free_flow`, `moderate`, `slow`, `congested`, `closed`
  - Road segment geometry (JSONB format)
  - Confidence score (data reliability)

**Technical Flow**:
```python
for road_segment in BUCHAREST_ROAD_GRID:
    fetch_traffic_conditions(segment_id)
    calculate_congestion_level(current_speed, free_flow_speed)
    detect_emission_zones(congestion > "slow")
    store_in_database(traffic_data table)
```

**Key Innovation**: We correlate traffic congestion with pollution **predictively**—when traffic slows below 15 km/h, we flag that area as a "High-Risk Emission Zone" before air sensors detect the spike.

##### **C. RAG Knowledge Pipeline** (`rag_ingestion.py`)
- **Sources**: 
  - RSS feeds (Romania Insider, HotNews, Digi24, Observator)
  - Web search via Serper API
  - BeautifulSoup web scraping
  - Future: Social media integration
- **Frequency**: Every 2 hours
- **Data Collected**:
  - Environmental events (fires, road closures, construction)
  - Breaking news affecting air quality
  - Official government alerts
  - Public health advisories

**Technical Flow**:
```python
scrape_news_sources()
extract_text_content(article)
classify_event_type([fire, traffic, pollution, construction, ...])
extract_location(text) → sector, neighborhood, lat/lon
calculate_severity(low → critical)
generate_embedding(text) → OpenAI Ada-002 (1536-dim vector)
store_in_database(environmental_events table)
```

**Key Innovation**: Vector embeddings enable **semantic search**. When a user asks "Are there any fires near me?", the system finds relevant events even if they use different wording (e.g., "incendiu", "flăcări", "fum").

#### **Step 2: Database Layer (PostgreSQL + pgvector)**

All collected data is stored in a high-performance PostgreSQL database with specialized extensions:

##### **Core Tables**:

1. **`pollution_locations`** (1,000 rows)
   - Geographic coordinates for each monitoring point
   - Maps to Bucharest's 6 sectors (location_id 0-5 → sectors 1-6)

2. **`pollution_data`** (millions of rows, time-series)
   - Real-time measurements from all 1,000 points
   - Indexed by `location_id` and `measured_at` for fast queries
   - Retention: 90 days of historical data

3. **`traffic_data`** (hundreds of thousands of rows)
   - Current traffic conditions per road segment
   - Indexed by `segment_id` and `collected_at`
   - Retention: 7 days of historical patterns

4. **`road_segments`** (static geometry)
   - JSONB storage for road shapes (enables map rendering)

5. **`environmental_events`** (RAG knowledge base)
   - Vector embeddings for semantic search (pgvector extension)
   - Location tagging (sector, neighborhood, lat/lon)
   - Expiration dates for time-sensitive events

##### **Smart Views & Functions**:

- **`latest_pollution_data`**: Automatically joins locations with their most recent readings (no manual time filtering needed)
- **`latest_traffic`**: Live traffic snapshot across all road segments
- **`recent_high_priority_events`**: Last 48 hours of critical events (severity ≥ high)
- **`get_events_near_location(lat, lon, radius_km)`**: Haversine distance calculation for proximity searches
- **`get_aqi_category(aqi)`**: Converts numeric AQI to human labels ("Good", "Moderate", "Unhealthy", etc.)

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Composite indexes on `(location_id, measured_at DESC)` enable sub-millisecond time-series queries
- pgvector's IVFFlat index accelerates nearest-neighbor searches for embeddings (100× faster than brute-force)

#### **Step 3: Backend Intelligence (Node.js + Gemini AI)**

The backend (`src/agent.js`, `src/aiSql.js`) acts as the **decision engine** that transforms raw data into actionable advice.

##### **A. Natural Language Query System**

When a user types a question in the chat, the system follows this workflow:

```javascript
User: "Is the air safe for a run near University Square?"
  ↓
1. PARSE INTENT (Gemini AI)
   → Detect entities: "run" (physical activity), "University Square" (location)
   → Infer need: Air quality + traffic + pollen data
  ↓
2. GENERATE SQL (Gemini AI with schema awareness)
   → "SELECT pm2_5, o3, us_aqi FROM latest_pollution_data 
       WHERE location_id = 2 LIMIT 1"
  ↓
3. EXECUTE QUERY (PostgreSQL)
   → Returns: {pm2_5: 45, o3: 78, us_aqi: 120}
  ↓
4. ANALYZE RESULTS (Gemini AI with health context)
   → Considers: User's health profile (asthma? allergies?)
   → Evaluates: PM2.5 > 35 (Unhealthy), O3 > 70 (Moderate)
  ↓
5. RESPOND (Conversational output)
   → "Not recommended. PM2.5 is 45 μg/m³ (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups).
       Wait until 7 PM when traffic clears."
```

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
async function conversationalAgent(userQuestion, userLocation, healthProfile) {
  // Step 1: Generate SQL query from natural language
  const sql = await generateSQL(userQuestion, DATABASE_SCHEMA);
  
  // Step 2: Safety checks (only SELECT allowed)
  if (!isSafeSelect(sql)) throw new Error("Query rejected");
  
  // Step 3: Execute against PostgreSQL
  const results = await pool.query(sql);
  
  // Step 4: AI analyzes results with context
  const response = await analyzeSQLResults(
    results.rows,
    userQuestion,
    userLocation,
    healthProfile
  );
  
  return response; // Human-readable answer
}
```

##### **B. Traffic-Aware Routing Intelligence**

The system doesn't just report traffic—it **reasons about alternatives**.

**Example Workflow**:
```
User: "Fastest route from Piața Unirii to Piața Victoriei?"
  ↓
1. Query current traffic on all connecting routes
2. Identify congested segments (congestion_level = 'congested')
3. Calculate alternative routes through side streets
4. Check pollution levels on each route
5. Recommend cleanest + fastest option
  ↓
Response: "Avoid Magheru Boulevard (congested, 15 min delay).
           Take Calea Victoriei instead (clear, 3 μg/m³ less PM2.5)."
```

**Temporal Intelligence**:
- Rush hour detection (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM) → suggests waiting
- Weather correlation (rain = less traffic, fog = slower speeds)
- Seasonal patterns (weekends less congested)

**Code Snippet**:
```javascript
const AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
TRAFFIC & ROUTING INTELLIGENCE:
- Current time matters: Rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM) are busier
- December weather: cold, rain clears traffic, fog may increase caution
- Alternative routes: Magheru Boulevard, Calea Victoriei, Splaiul Independenței

When a user asks about routing:
1. Check current time - suggest waiting if asking during peak hours
2. Query latest traffic data for actual congestion
3. Compare alternatives and recommend the clearest route
4. Consider weather and air quality
5. Be specific: road names, speeds, timing advice
`;
```

##### **C. Personalized Health Alerts**

The system integrates the user's health profile to adjust risk thresholds:

**Standard User**:
- AQI > 100 → "Moderate risk"

**User with Asthma**:
- AQI > 70 → "High risk" (triggered earlier)
- PM2.5 > 25 → "Avoid outdoor activity"
- O3 > 60 → "Use inhaler if needed"

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
function calculatePersonalizedRisk(airQuality, userProfile) {
  let riskLevel = 'low';
  let alerts = [];
  
  // Age-based sensitivity
  if (userProfile.age < 12 || userProfile.age > 65) {
    thresholds.aqi *= 0.8; // 20% lower threshold
  }
  
  // Condition-specific risks
  if (userProfile.hasAsthma) {
    if (airQuality.pm25 > 25) alerts.push("PM2.5 elevated - use inhaler");
    if (airQuality.o3 > 60) alerts.push("Ozone may trigger symptoms");
  }
  
  if (userProfile.allergies.includes('pollen')) {
    if (airQuality.pollen > 50) alerts.push("High pollen count - take antihistamine");
  }
  
  return { riskLevel, alerts };
}
```

#### **Step 4: Frontend Experience (React Native + Expo)**

The mobile/web app provides an intuitive interface for all the backend intelligence:

##### **A. Home Screen** (`index.tsx`)
- **Real-time Location Tracking**: Uses Expo Location API to get GPS coordinates
- **Nearest Sensor Selection**: Haversine formula calculates distance to all 1,000 sensors, selects closest
- **Map Visualization**: Overlays air quality heatmap on interactive map
- **Swipe Navigation**: Gesture-based transitions between map and metrics views

**Location Algorithm**:
```typescript
function selectNearestSensor(userLocation, sensors) {
  let closestSensor = sensors[0];
  let minDistance = Infinity;
  
  sensors.forEach(sensor => {
    // Haversine distance calculation (accounts for Earth's curvature)
    const distance = calculateHaversineDistance(
      userLocation.lat, userLocation.lon,
      sensor.lat, sensor.lon
    );
    
    if (distance < minDistance) {
      minDistance = distance;
      closestSensor = sensor;
    }
  });
  
  return closestSensor;
}
```

##### **B. AI Agent Screen** (`agent.tsx`)
- **Chat Interface**: Send natural language questions, receive conversational answers
- **Context Awareness**: Every query includes user location, current air quality, and device states
- **Smart Home Integration**: Built-in automation commands

**Automation Example**:
```typescript
if (userMessage.includes("run cleaning routine")) {
  const aqi = airQuality.aqi;
  
  if (aqi <= 70) {
    // Good air outside → ventilate
    openSmartWindow();
  } else {
    // Bad air outside → seal and purify
    closeSmartWindow();
    activateAirPurifier();
    activateUVLamp();
  }
  
  return `Automation complete. AQI is ${aqi}, windows ${aqi <= 70 ? 'opened' : 'closed'}.`;
}
```

##### **C. Health Profile Screen** (`profile.tsx`)
- **Persistent Storage**: AsyncStorage saves profile across sessions
- **Dynamic Alerts**: Thresholds adjust based on conditions
- **Privacy-First**: All health data stored locally on device

**State Management** (Zustand):
```typescript
export const useUserProfileStore = create((set) => ({
  profile: {
    age: 30,
    hasAsthma: false,
    allergies: ['pollen'],
    respiratoryConditions: [],
    otherConditions: []
  },
  
  updateProfile: async (newProfile) => {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('userProfile', JSON.stringify(newProfile));
    set({ profile: newProfile });
  }
}));
```

##### **D. Metrics Component** (`MetricsComponent.tsx`)
- **8 Key Metrics**: AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, O₃, temperature, humidity, UV index
- **Color-Coded Indicators**: Green (safe) → Red (unhealthy) → Purple (hazardous)
- **Educational Modals**: Tap any metric for detailed explanation and health ranges

**Color Logic**:
```typescript
function getMetricColor(metric, value) {
  const ranges = {
    pm25: [
      { max: 12, color: 'green' },   // Good
      { max: 35, color: 'yellow' },  // Moderate
      { max: 55, color: 'orange' },  // Unhealthy
      { max: 150, color: 'red' },    // Very Unhealthy
      { max: 500, color: 'purple' }  // Hazardous
    ]
  };
  
  for (const range of ranges[metric]) {
    if (value <= range.max) return range.color;
  }
}
```

### 5.4 The "Why" Behind the Architecture

**Q: Why 1,000 monitoring points instead of using existing government sensors?**
- Government sensors: 5-10 per city (low resolution)
- Our approach: 1,000 virtual sensors via Google Air Quality API
- Result: Street-level precision (100m accuracy vs. 5km accuracy)

**Q: Why Gemini AI instead of custom ML models?**
- Gemini provides natural language understanding out-of-the-box
- No training data needed (zero-shot learning)
- Handles multi-turn conversations natively
- Cost-effective (pay-per-token vs. maintaining GPU infrastructure)

**Q: Why PostgreSQL + pgvector instead of a specialized vector database?**
- Single database for structured + unstructured data (simpler architecture)
- ACID compliance for critical health data
- Mature ecosystem (replication, backups, monitoring)
- pgvector's IVFFlat indexing provides near-native vector DB performance

**Q: Why React Native instead of separate iOS/Android apps?**
- 90% code reuse across platforms (faster development)
- Web support via React Native Web (same codebase for mobile + web)
- Expo simplifies over-the-air updates (no app store approval delays)

### 5.5 Data Security & Privacy

- **Health Data**: Stored locally on-device (AsyncStorage), never sent to servers
- **Location Data**: Only sent to backend during active queries (not tracked passively)
- **Database Access**: Read-only SQL queries enforced (no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE allowed)
- **API Keys**: Environment variables only, never committed to version control

### 5.6 Performance Metrics

| Operation | Response Time | Optimization Technique |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| Air quality query | < 50ms | Indexed time-series lookups |
| Nearest sensor calculation | < 10ms | In-memory Haversine calculation |
| AI chat response | 1-3 seconds | Gemini 2.0 Flash (optimized for speed) |
| Map rendering | < 100ms | Cached tile layers + lazy loading |
| Traffic data update | 5-minute intervals | Batch processing + connection pooling |

### 5.7 Scalability Roadmap

**Current Capacity**:
- 1,000 monitoring points in Bucharest
- 10,000 concurrent users

**Expansion Plan**:
- **Phase 2**: Multi-city support (add Cluj, Timișoara, Iași)
- **Phase 3**: European expansion (5,000 points per city)
- **Phase 4**: Global coverage (integrate national air quality networks)

**Technical Approach**:
- Horizontal scaling via PostgreSQL read replicas
- Redis caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Cloudflare CDN for static map tiles
- Kubernetes for backend autoscaling

## 6. Real-World Use Cases

### The Young Family

**Context**: Want to take the baby for a stroller walk.

**Action**: They check the Time Slider. They see that rush hour ends at 10:00 AM and the air clears by 10:30 AM. They wait 30 minutes to protect the baby's lungs.

**Technical Flow**:
1. User opens app → GPS gets location
2. Frontend queries backend: `/api/air-quality/forecast?lat=44.4268&lon=26.1025`
3. Backend analyzes 24-hour trend from `pollution_data` table
4. AI identifies: "AQI drops from 120 → 65 at 10:30 AM (post-rush hour)"
5. Frontend displays: "Best time to go outside: 10:30 AM"

### The Urban Jogger

**Context**: Preparing for a run.

**Action**: They ask the Chatbot: *"Best route for a 5k run?"* The AI suggests a route through the park that avoids the two main boulevards currently gridlocked with traffic.

**Technical Flow**:
1. User types question in agent chat
2. Backend parses intent: "route planning + air quality consideration"
3. SQL query: `SELECT road_name, congestion_level, pm25 FROM latest_traffic JOIN latest_pollution_data`
4. AI identifies: Magheru Blvd (congested, PM2.5: 65) vs. Herăstrău Park (clear, PM2.5: 18)
5. Response: *"Run through Herăstrău Park. Magheru Blvd has 3.6× higher pollution right now."*

### The Homeowner

**Context**: Cooking dinner.

**Action**: They receive a Smart Alert: *"Outdoor air quality dropping rapidly due to heavy traffic."* They keep the windows closed and rely on the internal purifier.

**Technical Flow**:
1. Background monitoring detects: AQI jumped from 55 → 105 in 15 minutes
2. System correlates with `traffic_data`: 3 nearby road segments changed to "congested"
3. Alert triggered: "High-Risk Emission Zone detected within 500m"
4. If smart home connected: Auto-command sent to Google Home → close smart windows + activate purifier
5. Push notification sent to user's phone
